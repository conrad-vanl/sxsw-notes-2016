# Panel


### What are the best 3 new apps you've seen, used in the past 60 days, and why are they in your rotation to become permenant on your screen

Ben: 
  Enlight. Utility to image processing on small device.
  Facebook. Because they are always launching new, a/b testing, etc
  British Airways App. Have a lot of contextual ui working. Nice motion. Subtle progression

Suzy:
  Slack. Incredible to move off of email
  Recharge. Resell unused hotel rooms by the hour for day working
  Skirt. On-demand car rental

Asif:
  Google Translate. High amount of utility when traveling
  Like so. Speach practicing app. Tries to train your speach
  FlyCar. Rent your own car while you are traveling

Dylan:
  Sensei. Machine learning AI, that lives inside of chat programs
  Hound. Voice recognition app
  Music Impacts. bring people into music



### something about re-inventing the app experience

Ben:
  getting harder to come up with new and innovative app conventions.
  a lot of examples now predicate off of additional screens (watch, tv)
  more and more apps will get more customized interfaces for the individual user

Asif:
  sensors in the device that we aren't using today very much - gyro, accel, etc
  factor in this data and re-invent or customize experience based on that

  adding sensors to beacons to get even additional information. Put gyo in a beacon that goes on a 
  clothing item at the store. You pick up item, beacon knows you tried it on...

Suzy:
  gave another example of using beacon + sensors


### Force touch. Used, unused?

Ben:
  it's working in our apps...but not on all platforms yet. So purely meta.
  challene to address as its a convention not accessible to everyone yet


### Invisible app world...apps that are integrated to other apps (Slack Bots). What have you seen happening?

Ben:
  microservices. Fox and the hedgehog. Fox can do many things (jack of all trades), hedgehog does one thing well. 
  Difficult to be an effective fox, because everyone expects the best

Asif:
  Sees a lot of integration of apps (Foursquare and OpenTable).
  Building virtual stores


### VR, AR: Mobile. A lot of promise from product develoeprs that this is what we want. But do we really want it? When will it be here.

Ben:
  Got a ways to go with gear. Most gear looks like a toaster that mates to your forehead.
  Glimpses of possibility: someone in a hospital bed can espcape their current reality

Suzy:
  2016 will be excited with a lot of consumer hardware devices coming to play.

Dylan:
  Just wonder if it's something I'll come back to every day...only way we can get conusmer adoption is really great app experiences

Ben:
  Technology is coming. Can get a transparent touch-scren oled tv. 

Asif:
  VR hardware is ways away. AR is getting there, see a lot of adoption this year.
  A lot of it will be hinged on tieing it into the social platforms that are out there.
  
  How do you find new music? Experimenting with an AR solution where you walk in a coffee shop and there's 
  a track 'hanging' in the air that you can try out that someone else left.

Ben:
  AR audio track that was built by the other people walking through the park.

__Request for Product:__ social music sharing app where people can 'pick' songs that are perfect for a given spot, and other people that come by can listen to it.

__Spotify location based playlists?__


### How do we fix app discovery as a whole?

Ben:
  not an easy one, comes down to apps that resonate immediately.
  Needs immediate resonance. 

  on discovery side - machine learning. charts on itunes has nothing to do with 'me' - not personalized

Suzy:
  product hunt. Built incredible community of technology and app enthusisats. Democratized the tech crunch / big app business people of the world.

Asif:
  Thinks it's less about discovery. More about the developers doing intelligent promotion. Apps need to surface to potential users at the right time. Moving to an ambient app economy...

  Apps are going to become temporal

Suzy:
  Following up on intelligent promotion....love building apps on idea of building customers - use community to be the spokespeople. Ex: Maven - AA woman that gets a weave every month - provides a tech platform to source hair from India and give directly to stylists. Maven owns customer relationship, stylists becomes direct marketing force. 

### If I were to give each of you $20 mil now, what 3 types of companies would you back and why?

Ben:
  Business and Enterprise software. Has a long way to go...if you've started your own company you know how much noise there is in business software. Investing in productivity software for business that directly addresses the need and velocity of a startup is a huge.

  Machine Learning. Think IoT is going to be predicated on machine learning.

  VR. Lot of potential in VR. Specifically on the hardware side.

Suzy:
  Balance between Consumer, Enterprise and Impact perspective. Went social-well-being route...wants to "save the world" a little bit.

  Talked about "Thrive Market" - whole foods meets costco.

Asif:
  AR, VR.

  Followed by IoT. 

  Obviously he loves acronyms
