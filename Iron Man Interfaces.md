## The Next Generation of UI

# Interfaces of Iron Man, Avengers, Big Hero 6, etc

Soon, people will be able to design things in ways that they see in hollywood films. Presented by someone (missed name...first name Jayce) that designs interfaces for feature films...like Iron Man - designs the iron man suit interface, for example.

a lot of design works go in to designing/concepting the UX that actors interact with in film. Part of the story telling device.

_(__Story Driven Design__)_

__Z-Space / Animation Layers__

Level 0 in z-space - main level. Where animation happens.

Every level is below Level 0, and further back in z-space. Represents subtle effects of contextual information that's not as important.

When we bring these ideas to the real world, we bring in ideas from film such as opacity and ambient occlusion. 

Design is fairly minimal in film to allow for characters to not be obstructed by the interface.

In Iron Man, the "in-helmet" shots used with Robert Downy Jr. was created to show the actor's face.

Need interfaces that can convey story in fractional time (gave example of a 3 sec shot with Iron Man where he's flying and his UI conveys an incomming missle)

__Apps are going to be volumetric. No longer just thinking about user's point of view.__ The user's main view might be flat and lined up, but with z-space, off-center viewing will be skewed and need to be thought of that.

__Key takeaways from work in film (esp holographic UX+UI)__

- anchoring graphics to real world (ancoring to a workspace or hub for ex.)
- direct manipulation (being able to 'touch' holographic elements)
- collaborative (support multiple users + vantage points)

# Taking these ideas and applying to real world

All interfaces today are evolutions on the original windows + icons based design.

Today: what can we learn from UX in modern hollywood? What can we learn from science?

Thesis: Computers are so amazing, we don't notice how terrible they are.

Phones break our eye-contact...we get distracted by devices that ruin person-to-person moments (like when you're talking to someone and their phone goes off). They also can bring people together (showing something). The difference here is in perspective - modern UIs are optimized for a single vantage point....being hunched over a rectangular screen and becoming isolated from those that don't share your vantage point. 

Interfaces have path(s) of resistance. In photoshop, how many different steps does it take to select a paint brush, brush type, color, etc. This path of resistance takes away from your creativity. 

Gestures and direct manipulation with your hands are easier to understand and learn then layers of UI complexity. Need to think beyond rectangles and boxes and boundaries.

### Natural Machines ###

New kind of computer bulit from the ground up on principles of neuroscience. 

1. Needs to put holograms into the world in 3d
2. Needs to use our hands a 3d input
3. Needs to take into account the people around us, not just a single viewer

Shows off the "Meta 2" device with simple AR demonstration.
Then continues to some use case videos

Future: use devices to extend ourselves, instead of other way around
Putting digital layer of information on top of our reality

Instead of letting designers dish out how to design the next interface, they're working with neuroscience. 

__Neural path of least resistance__: undo the last 30 years of UI complexity. Create computing with zero learning curve. 

To build this, we have three principle:

1. You are the OS. Ex. Use physical space to abstract file space
2. Touch to See. Interact with elements iwth your body in real world space
3. Holographic Campfire. Utilize holograms with other users, different perspectives
