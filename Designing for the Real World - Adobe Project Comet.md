## Prototyping 
### Make

"A prototype is wroth a thousand meetings"
- a saying at IDEO

Making it as real as possible is always the goal - more clearity in the feel, affect, etc

If you can't make it "real enough" you can't adequately solve the problems you're set out to solve

But...adds more complexity and overhead to workflow

_Got to find the balance?_

"You are not the user"

Take to heart...test as often as possible. Share.

Build strong relationships with other teams. His example - they worked with AirBNB's design team to get ideas, bounce back feedback, etc (on Project Comet).

## Learn

"Edge cases define the boundaries of who and what you care about"

We bring a lot of bias input into design. 

Lorem ipsum serves us well, but hurts us in more ways:
- it's not real
- the problem with 'real' is that it takes time and work

"Designer Ipsum":
- nice images,
- well shot product shots,
- good looking avatars
- inspiring visuals ... things you throw in your designs to:
- helps sell the design

Still...limiting your view, biasing your world.

You're setting up the conditions for the ideal user...the ideal string of text, ideal photos, visuals, etc.
But when you have to "make it real" - go into production - it's not always going to look good. It's going to break.

## Project Comet

- Goal: building all these ideas into project comet
