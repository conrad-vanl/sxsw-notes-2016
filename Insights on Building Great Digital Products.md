He had obsession to organize creative world. 

Creators are people that come up with great content - that compels us to take action. Make us care about and engage with the things in our daily life.

But creators are often those that take disorganization with a badge of honor.

## _The more obvious a product looks, the harder it was to create_

It's easy to solve problems by adding complexity...

The relative joy of building
(there's a graph that looks like a stock market graph with cyclical peaks and troughs poking fun at the product development lifecycle)

- Joy is at peak when there are unknowns ahead....
- unknowns are valleys when they're realized...you're down with more problems to solve

Aspire for a positive slope - know it's one step forward, two steps back

Ground decisions with a few simple convictions

## _Life is just time and how you use it_

All products can be abstracted to spending time (xbox, news, etc) or saving time (uber, slack, evernote) <-- or, at the least, the allure of that

And there are products that are a mix of that: Twitter is meant to save time by reading shorter content, and spend time by discovering new content

## Products and how they relate to life

We fight to save time and seduced to spend time at all times

Cornerstore as product makers to navigate

Why are tendencies so important?

- tendancies are reflexives...things we will do regardless:
  - to accomplish more with minimal effort
  - to avoid difficult decisions
  - preserve our options
  - want to be recognized
  - want to look good

- human tendencies are the twilight zone for time when using products

- if you can accomodate natural human tendencies you can win your user's time

## Human Tendency: sad state of humanity (laziness)

The realization that in the first 15 seconds of product utilization is that we're lazy and selfish. We don't have time to read or learn something new. Limited tolerance to understand something new - fight for the time of your life.

1. Naturally we try to show things instead of explain things...incrementally expose users to functionality. 

2. What's even better: doing something for the user. In design apps - give them templates that they can start with. Smart selection vs manual entry (ex. autocopmlete).

3. Presumptious defaults. Users don't tend to change defaults...defaults put a lot of sway on a user's product experience. 98%+ of users accept the defaults. We need to spend a lot of time designing the default user experience of a product.

Smart product teams spend a lot of their time on the nuances of usage, edge cases, etc. Then in the last mile start to build the onboarding experience etc. Which is absolutely backwards...a new user is most often lost in "the first mile" of the product (like onboarding)...but if you can get them through that you have much more time to convince them to stay with the product.

#### ego analytics

Proving to the user that this product is helping the user "look good". 

Instagram: user activity goes up immediately after they post something (users tend to use the app more after the post something themselves). Getting ego-gratification. Looking to see how others are using their own content, seeing what other content is available with theirs.

### skepticism

Users are skeptical of a company's intentions. 

Utility must come before the grater promises of the product.

Pinterest wasn't social at first...it focused on bookmarking things you liked.

Stripe has done really well engaging developers....it's a payment product, but they know that developers are their users, and the shelfishness in this sense is the developer. Easier to use as a developer is what's they focused on.

Copy isn't so important.

Small teams make some of the best products...because you don't have discrete teams that aren't involved with each other working on each small part (marketing copy, email campaigns, product design, product copy, etc).

## Human Tendency: Simplicity

More options, more problems

The product lifecycle:

1. Users flock to simple product
2. Product adds features to appease users, adds complexity.
3. Users flock to simple product

Making simple is very complicated. Staying simple is even harder.

He argues: you should preserve 50% of experience on new user experience. Continue allocating resources in your team to new users even as your product usage grows. Don't just focus on taking users for granted and adding features for existing users. Keep re-optimizing new user experience.

## Human Tendency: We cling to familiarity

We seek novelty, love trying new things, being used...but at the same time seek familiarity ... know how things works ... how to post comments is the same from one product to the next. 

Psychology here: the 'lizard brain' - all of us has through evolution - we are comfortable with familiarity but recoil from something new ("DangeR!! turn around!"). 

As product builders: adopt familiar patterns when ever it's possible. Don't try to reinvent the wheel or rename things that creates friction. DOn't make the "First mile" longer.

Don't do novel things.

"Human UI": little things that are familiar patterns to help us solve problems

Give familiarity to customers whenever we can

__How to decide when to force something novel?__

When the decision encapsulates the core vision of the product. The novelty is the ransformation of product.

Products are like....90% accomodating, 10% transforming

Familiarity can be the enemy of innovation, but it's the friend of utilization

## Human Tendency: Disportionately allocate energy
