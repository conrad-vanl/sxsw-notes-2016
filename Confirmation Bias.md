## Confirmation Bias

People tend to come up with a hypothesis, then test it by confirming that hypothesis. 

Instead, seek to disconfirm your hypothesis.

"That makes sense, I'll stop here" - manifestation of confirmation bias

## How can we keep our beliefs from getting in our way?

### How brain process information:

Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1 and System 2 thinking

- System 1:
  - Fast
  - Automatic
  - Uncounscious
  - Every day decisions
  - Error Prone
- System 2:
  - Slow
  - Effortful
  - Conscious
  - Complex decisions
  - Reliable

### Selective Attention

Our brains can't actively process everything

Only processes what it thinks is important..even if there's striking information in the way it can ignore it.

Since our product is important to you, it is easy to only process information that confirms its success

## When synthesizing feedback

- Push yourself to focus on user feedback that varies from the ideas/goals that you believe are important to you

## Observer/Expectancy Effect

When observer drives the result with their expectancy

- body language
- asking pointed questions

## Primacy Effect

Information gathered early in a process is easiest to remember
^ can be more easily accepted as truth later on

Forming early opinions - tend to judge all subsequent information against that believe. 

Primacy Effect leads to "Belief Persistance"

Check yourself: are you comparing all new pieces of information equally?

## Frequency Illusion

"Everyone is in a relationship except me"

Phenomenon when someone who just learns something new suddenly sees it everywhere

Comes up a lot when you're identifying pain points

When sizing a pain point:

- ask yourself if you've stumbled upon something huge (maybe, maybe not)
- be aware that just because "everyone" suddenly has this problem, doesn't mean that "everyone" is actually plagued by it (go seek quantitative analyst)

## Availability Heuretics

Everyone thinks shark attacks are a fear at the beach.

You're 30 times more likely to die from a falling airplane part then a shark attack at a beach

Shark attacks are sensational, human condition is fascinated by them, and we get a lot more information about sharks, so we tend to be more bias towards that.

On demand products: "Uber for X"

Everyone hears how successful uber is, so "on demand" products are a huge buzz. Lots of $$ being invested in on-demand products, but more fail then are successful.


## Pro-innovation bias

The tendency to have an excessive optimism towards an invention while often failing to identify its limitaitons or weaknesses.

### When deciding if your solution is "big enough..."

- be optimistic, but realistic
- ask yourself which aspects you can improve

# Combatting Confirmation Bias

## Team Structure

- Diverse thought in teams
- But keep it small...2-pizza team with diverse backgrounds to help balance individual biases

## Organizational Structure

- Core teams focusing on their own problems, with
- cross-project individuals that are focused "research" / "discovery" across multiple projects (Capital One calls them "Design Researcher"). Helps to come in and lead unbias decisions
