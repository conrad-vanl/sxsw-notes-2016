## Diets

- 3rd cnetury: Hippocrates...slow running, hard work vomiting after lunch. see-water enmas
- 19th century: 14 oz. wine each day
....
- 1950s cabbage soup
- Today - weight watchers, slim fast, medical products


### _The word innovate used to have cheifly negative connation_

Redeemed in 1939
"Brining new products to market"

Over past decade, word "innovate" has ooming

Even food companies use "innovation" now

We are craving innovation.

2700 books about Bell Labs on Amazon.....
824 about Xerox PARC

### Fads?

When smart people apply energy to something, results get better

The word diet stems from greek meaning "way of life"

_If we want innovation we need it as a way of life, not a "diet" or "fad"_

## DAARPA

She explained a bit about her background with Daarpa. Went to Afghanistan, learend from troops out there that Daarpa traditionally focus on "long term problems" - but she persisted on prolblems they have now, learned that they (the troops) feel like Daarpa has abandoned them, don't have many long term problems but lots of daily and monthly problems. 

Then went to war in Afghanistan in 9 months...

Observed: big breakthrough delivered at scale and speedily is not brittle. It is robust - to times, to world conditions, to spec leadership at the time. An existence proof that innovation can be a discipiline. A way of life within an organization in a company.

### How does Daarpa achieve this? Can we bring it to other organizations?

Most people think about innovation as a linear process:

  1. Basic science
  2. Applied Science
  3. Productization

in the 40's and 50's technology boomed to national security. People looked at that and wanted to see how to apply to economics. Devised the three basic baskets (above). But lots of controversy where people in community said "that's not how it happened"...but for decades these three baskets have been the model for breakthrough innovation.

Became social fact. 

Breakthrough innovation at Daarpa didn't look like those 3 steps at all.

### __Stoke's theory__ challenges this linear model:

He had proposed a quadrant:

```
                              Driving Application?
                              No                        Yes
                              ------------------------------------------------------
High basic science content    | Purse basic research  | Use-inspired basic research |
                              ------------------------------------------------------
Low basic science content     |                       | Pure applied research       |
                              ------------------------------------------------------
```

Real breakthrough happens in upper right hand quadrant - use-inspired basic research. Ex: there's a food shortage, how do we fix it?

But science isn't well related to business. You can't put deadlines on science breakthroughs. In the name of risk-deduction, scientists negotiate themselves to the lower-left hand quadrant where science doesn't matter, but just deadlines.

Upper right quadrant is where epic shit happens.

Lower left is epic but in shitty way: products less ambitious to make product ship deadlines, less agressive. Creates environment where people aren't excited about their work...execution risk goes up. Upper-right yeilds results far more often because people become passionate about breakthrough innovation.

### Epic shit occurs at this intersection

Establishing the discipline to do this is the challenge for innovation @ scale.

But people don't see or remember that battle...they instead rememeber the results.


## Results

Google Advanced Tech Dep't is in this model of the quadrant above. Didn't exist 4 years ago.

### Wearables

Wearables have been talked about for 30 years. They found answers in a paper written in 1954 in a research about the motor functionality of the human brain "Human Motor Control System". 

Shows a graph that states that as screen size decreases, the load on the human motor control system increases.

Fitz, in 1954, tested this by having people interact with things at different sizes.

She found that the absolute limit of interactivity is the smart watch - it's at the size of a fundamental limitation of size that we can interact with. Anything smaller won't have value.

### Project Soli

Captures the ability for a human to interact with very intricate thigns (shows a video of a watch smith working on very small, moving parts). 

Talks about how we need to figure out interactions that optimize the usage of our hands. 

Google is working on being able to map and record very precise movements of your hand and fingers

Focus is building interactions that have high bit rate with the human motor system so you can have interactions on smaller screens

### Project Jacquard

The construct of a capacitive touch sensor is very similar to a textile (clothing). Working on making conductive yarn...so you can make touch-screen surfaces on your clothes.

### Project ARA

Modular phone, made up of peices. Allows you to choose the parts that matter to you

"software is eating the world" 2011

but prior to that hardware was king

What would a hardware renassiance looks like connected to the mobile web?

__We need a HArdware "API"..this is their first version of one__

Talked a lot about connecting discrete hardware devices...instead of your phone being the core of it all

### Google Spotlight Stories

Mobile graphics performance started intersecting with power of consoles and pcs in 2014.

Utility and fun hard to intersect (Microsoft Clipy)

Industry spends lots of $$$ on making tasks more efficient

Talks about 360 video and a lot of work they did to improve it

including dynamic 3d audio

new authoring tools (non linear 360 degree stories)

Created new stories where the technology is in service to the story itself

## Fear of Failure is the problem

Need to turn the impossible to the improbable to the inevitable

When we choose to make something epic, we actively choose to be terrified.....choose to live in the vulnerability of that fear
